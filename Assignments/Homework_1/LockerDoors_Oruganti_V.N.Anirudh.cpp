****** Question 5 (Reference) ******
There a n lockers in a hallway, numbered sequentially from 1 to n. Initially, all the locker
doors are closed. You make n passes by the lockers, each time starting with locker #1. 
On the ith pass, i = 1, 2, â€¦., n, you toggle the door of every ith locker: if the door is
closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it. After the last pass, display the following
output:
(a) Which locker doors are open and which ones are closed?
(b) Give the count of open locker doors are open?
Hint: Accept user input for number of passes and number of locker doors.
